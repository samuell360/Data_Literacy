# What is Probability? 🎲

Welcome to the fascinating world of probability! Think of probability as your **uncertainty meter** - it measures how likely something is to happen on a scale from 0 to 1.

## 🎯 Real-World Connection

Imagine you're about to "shuffle" your favorite playlist. Probability tells you **how likely** the next song matches your mood:
- **0** = Impossible (no chance your favorite artist plays when they're not in your playlist)
- **0.5** = 50-50 chance (like flipping a fair coin)  
- **1** = Guaranteed (certain to happen)

## 📚 Key Terminology

**🔬 Experiment:** The process you're doing (hitting shuffle once)  
**🌌 Sample Space \(S\):** All possible outcomes (all songs in your playlist)  
**🎯 Event:** What you care about (e.g., "Taylor Swift plays next")

## 🎨 The Three Flavors of Probability

### 1. **Classical Probability** 🧮
When all outcomes are equally likely:
\[P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}\]

**Example:** Rolling a fair die → \(P(\text{getting a 3}) = \frac{1}{6}\)

### 2. **Empirical Probability** 📊
Based on observed data from experiments:
\[P(\text{Event}) = \frac{\text{Number of times event occurred}}{\text{Total number of trials}}\]

**Example:** If it rained 15 days out of the last 50 days → \(P(\text{rain}) = \frac{15}{50} = 0.3\)

### 3. **Subjective Probability** 🧠
Personal belief based on experience and judgment (when data is limited).

**Example:** "I think there's a 70% chance I'll enjoy this new movie"

## ⚖️ Universal Rules (These NEVER Break!)

### Rule 1: Probability Range
\[0 \leq P(A) \leq 1\]
Probabilities must be between 0 and 1 (inclusive).

### Rule 2: Total Probability
All possible outcomes' probabilities **sum to 1**:
\[\sum P(\text{all possible outcomes}) = 1\]

### Rule 3: Complement Rule
\[P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)\]
The probability of "not A" equals 1 minus the probability of A.

**Example:** If \(P(\text{rain}) = 0.3\), then \(P(\text{no rain}) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

## 📈 Law of Large Numbers (LLN)

The more times you repeat an experiment, the closer your observed frequency gets to the true probability.

**🎯 Example:** Flip a coin 1,000 times
- After 10 flips: might get 7 heads (70%)
- After 100 flips: might get 47 heads (47%)  
- After 1,000 flips: should get close to 500 heads (50%)

## 💡 Practice Examples

### Example 1: Card Deck
Standard deck has 52 cards with 4 Aces.
\[P(\text{drawing an Ace}) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13} ≈ 0.077\]

### Example 2: Weather Forecast  
If weather app says 30% chance of rain:
- \(P(\text{rain}) = 0.3\)
- \(P(\text{no rain}) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

### Example 3: Survey Data
From 400 graduates, 120 owe ≥$20k in loans:
\[P(\text{high debt}) = \frac{120}{400} = 0.30 = 30\%\]

## 🎯 Quick Tips for Success

1. **Always check your answer:** Is it between 0 and 1?
2. **Use complements:** Sometimes \(P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)\) is easier to calculate
3. **Think "favorable over total"** for classical probability
4. **More data = better estimates** for empirical probability
