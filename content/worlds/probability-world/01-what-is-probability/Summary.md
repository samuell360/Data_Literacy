# 🎯 Probability Essentials - Quick Review

## 📏 **Probability Range**
- Probability lives in **[0,1]** (between 0% and 100%)
- **0** = Impossible, **1** = Certain

## ⚖️ **Fundamental Rules**
- All simple outcome probabilities **sum to 1**
- **Complement Rule:** \(P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)\)
- If \(P(\text{rain}) = 0.3\), then \(P(\text{no rain}) = 0.7\)

## 🎨 **Three Types of Probability**
- **Classical:** Equal likelihood → \(\frac{\text{favorable}}{\text{total}}\)
- **Empirical:** Based on observed data → \(\frac{\text{occurred}}{\text{trials}}\)
- **Subjective:** Personal belief/judgment

## 📈 **Law of Large Numbers (LLN)**
- More trials → observed frequency approaches true \(P\)
- Coin flips: 10 flips might give 70% heads, 1000 flips ≈ 50% heads

## 💡 **Key Examples**
- **Card deck:** \(P(\text{Ace}) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}\)
- **Weather:** \(P(\text{rain}) = 0.3\) → \(P(\text{no rain}) = 0.7\)
- **Survey:** 120 out of 400 → \(P = 0.30 = 30\%\)

> **Remember:** Always check if your answer is between 0 and 1! 🎲
