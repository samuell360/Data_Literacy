# Hypergeometric (without replacement)

Finite population \(N\) with \(R\) successes; sample size \(n\) **without replacement** (dependent draws):
\[
P(X=x)=\frac{\binom{R}{x}\binom{N-R}{\,n-x\,}}{\binom{N}{n}}
\]

**Compare:** Binomial is with replacement/independent trials; Hypergeometric is without replacement (dependence across draws).
