# Unions & Intersections (A or B, A and B)

Your {{THEME}} row has **Comedies (A)** and **Sci-Fi (B)**.  
**Union \(A\cup B\)** = "A or B (or both)".  
**Intersection \(A\cap B\)** = "A and B" (overlap).  
**Mutually exclusive** = can't happen together (e.g., "rolled 1" and "rolled 2").

## Addition rules
- If exclusive: \(P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)\)
- General: \(P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)\)  (subtract the double-count)

### Mini example
\(P(A)=0.4, P(B)=0.5, P(A\cap B)=0.25\) â‡’ \(P(A\cup B)=0.65\).
