# Discrete Random Variables + EMV

A game pays \(\$x\) with probability \(p(x)\). Over time, your **expected value** \(E[X]\) is the long-run average payoff.

- **Valid distribution:** \(0\le p(x)\le1\), \(\sum p(x)=1\)
- **Mean:** \(E[X]=\sum x\,p(x)\)
- **Variance/std:** \(\text{Var}=\sum (x-\mu)^2p(x)\), \(\sigma=\sqrt{\text{Var}}\)
- **EMV:** \(E[X]\) when \(x\) is dollars â†’ compare deals fairly

**Relate it:** If your {{THEME}} app pays different coin rewards with different chances, EMV is the "average coins per attempt" in the long run.
