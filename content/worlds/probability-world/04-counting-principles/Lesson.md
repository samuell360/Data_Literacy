# Counting Principles (product rule, permutations, combinations)

Building an outfit from **tops** and **shoes**? That's the **product rule**: multiply choices per step.

- **Product rule:** total outcomes = choices₁ × choices₂ × …
- **Permutations \(nPr\):** order matters
- **Combinations \(nCr\):** order doesn't matter

### Mini examples
2 tops × 3 shoes = 6 outfits.  
\(5C2=10\) ways to pick 2 from 5 (order doesn't matter).  
License plates: 2 letters then 3 digits (repeats allowed) = \(26^2\times 10^3\).
